```{r}
library(data.table) # data.table package will be used to complete most of the tasks
data_full <- fread("bank/bank-full.csv")
data <- fread("bank/bank.csv")

## 1. -----
n <- round(nrow(data_full)*0.1, 0) # 10% of data
smpl <- data_full[sample(.N, n)]

## 2. -----
duom <- data_full[pdays != (-1)] # choosing customers who were contacted before
duom[duom == "unknown"] <- NA
duom <- na.omit(duom)

x1 <- duom[!job %in% c("unemployed", "retired", "student") & balance > 0 & housing == "no" & loan == "no"] # works, positive balance, no loan (housing and personal)
head(x1)

## 3. -----
x2 <- duom[, !c("housing", "default")]
head(x2)
a <- NULL; a$ncol1 <- ncol(duom); a$ncol2 <- ncol(x2); a # two columns were deleted

setnames(x1, c("housing", "y"), c("housingloan", "termdep")) # renaming two variables

## 4. -----

table(duom$y) # shows how many people are subsribed a term deposit and how many are not

round(prop.table(table(duom$job, duom$y), margin = 1), 3) # percentages by type of job (each row sums to 1). We can see what each job group tends to choose more and compare choises between groups

round(prop.table(table(duom$education, duom$y), margin = 1), 3) # percentages by education (each row sums to 1). It kinda shows that people who have higher education level intends to subscribe a term deposit a bit more


dat <- as.data.frame(duom)
q <- sapply(dat, class)
x3 <- dat[, noquote(q == "numeric") | (q == "integer")] # choosing numeric or integer class variables for summary statistics
summary(x3, digits = 5)

pp <- seq(0.1, 0.90, 0.1)
sapply(x3, quantile, probs = pp) # quantiles

duom[, .(median(duration), mean(balance)), by = .(housing, job)] #  median of last contact durations and average balance by people who have housing loan or not and by their job categories


## 5. -----
library(lubridate)
duom[, "date" := ymd(paste(2011, duom$month, duom$day))] # creating date variable
duom[, "day_of_week" := weekdays(duom$date)] # day of week variable

duom[, "birthdate" := 2011-age] # calculating birth date from age variable

duom[, "ageclass" := factor(cut(age, breaks = c(min(age), 34, 50, 70, max(age))))] # new variable with age groups
table(duom$ageclass)

## 6. -----
x4 <- duom[order(rank(job), -balance, age)] # ordering data by job, balance and age. Jobs by alphabet, balance - descending, age - ascending.
